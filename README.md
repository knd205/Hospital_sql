Hanoi Medical University Hospital Management System Project

The objective of this project is to provide recommendations for how a comprehensive database system can help nurses and doctors better manage patient flow. By collecting operational data and examining the inefficiencies and gaps that arise from the absence of a standardized database, this analysis will use entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) and relational models to provide a visual representation of the problem. The data will then be imported into a database using SQLServer, allowing for enhanced problem depiction and highlighting the critical need for hospitals to adopt robust digital tools for patient management.

This project aimed to develop a centralized patient record management database system for Hanoi Medical University Hospital. Through conceptual, logical and physical database design processes, we created relational database schemas and implemented them using SQL. Sample queries were written applying clauses such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY and JOIN according to the business needs.


Here the diagram for the concept of the database

To conclude the project, I hereby summarize some of the advantages and limitations of the database:
 Advantages of the system:
-Data consolidation: The database consolidates patient records from multiple departments into a single centralized system, improving care coordination.
-Access to history: Doctors and nurses can easily access a patient's full medical history from any point of time, therefore ensuring them not missing any notable medical history out.
-Increased efficiency: Record searching, reports and analytics can be performed faster through the database.
-Analytics capabilities: Aggregated data and reporting tools can provide insights to improve the patientâ€™s health.

Potential limitations:
-High management cost: Cost of development and maintenance of the complex system.
-New staff training: Requires training staff on use of the new database system. 
-Electricity lost: Technical difficulties or downtime could disrupt clinical workflow.
